<h1>Weather App</h1><br>
A weather app is a software application designed to provide users with current and forecasted weather conditions for their location or any other specified location. These apps typically display information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and sometimes additional data like UV index or air quality. Users can often customize their preferences, such as temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) or time format. Many weather apps also offer features like weather alerts, radar maps, and daily or hourly forecasts to help users plan their activities accordingly.
